# Home Automation
## INTRODUCTION
- An internet-based home automation system focuses on controlling home electronic devices whether you are inside or outside your home.
- Home automation gives an individual the ability to control things remotely or automatically around the home.
- A home appliance is a device or instrument designed to perform a specific function, especially an electrical device, such as a refrigerator for household use.
- The words appliance and devices are used interchangeably. 

- Automation is todayâ€™s fact, where things are being controlled automatically, usually the basic tasks of turning on/off certain devices and beyond, either remotely or in proximity.
- The concept of remote management of household devices over the internet from anywhere, any time in the world today can be a reality.
- Assume a system where from the office desk, the user could view the status of the devices and decides to take control to turn on the cooling system, say the air conditioner, and switches on or off some of the lights etc.

- The recent developments in technology which permit the use of radio frequency technology such as Bluetooth, have enabled different devices to have capabilities of communicating with each other.
- Bluetooth is a new technology, which has at its center the goal of eliminating wired connections between computers. 
- Instead of connecting with wires, every appliance has small transmitters/receivers. The radio frequency used (2.4 GHz) is so high that the range of transmission will be small (about 30 feet). 
- This is important because the range is so small, that it can be used in apartments without much interference to your neighbors or from them. 
- These are a few reasons that make Bluetooth technology ideal for home automation. 
- With this in mind, I propose to design an internet-based home automation system for remote control of home appliances.
