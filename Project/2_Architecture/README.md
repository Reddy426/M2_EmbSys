## Explanation:-
1.	Temperature Sensor: -
-	Temperature sensors measure the atmospheric temperature and send the data to home automation system (Microcontroller).
-	Home automation system which controls the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HV AC).

2.	PIR Sensor: -
-	A PIR Sensor is utilized to identify the infrared radiation from the warm object.
-	As it comprises of sensor which start changes in their temperature (because of occurrence infrared radiation) into electric flag called PYRO ELECTRIC SENSORS.
-	It produces an electric charge when infrared light strikes a gem.
-	Like this, PIR Sensor recognize an encompassing attribute (Person) moving around roughly just inside 10m from the PIR Sensor.

3.	Gas Sensor: -
-	Gas sensor is a device which sense the presence of various gases within an area, usually as part of a safety system.
-	This type of devices is used to detect a gas leak and interface with a microcontroller so a process can be automatically shut down.
-	A gas sensor can also sound an alarm to operators in the area where the leak is occurring, giving them the opportunity to leave the area.

4.	Light Sensor: -
-	Light intensity data can help you to automate your lighting system to switch it on or off.
-	 Switching off light automatically with your home automation system, where light intensity is high enough to see, will save energy. 
-	You can also create your own luminance data table and use it to automate your application to regulate when to switch lights on or off.

5.	Relay: -
-	Relays are a fundamental device for switching an electrical circuit on or off, much like a toggle switch or a limit switch. 
-	But a relay is operated based on an electrical control signal obtained from Sensors as opposed to a toggle switch that is operated by a microcontroller, or by equipment contact.

6.	Bluetooth model: -
-	This module enables you to wireless transmit & receive serial data.
-	 It is a drop-in replacement for wired serial connections allowing transparent two-way data communication. 
-	You can simply use it for serial port replacement to establish connection between MCU.
