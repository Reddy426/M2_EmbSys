# About Automatic water level control
## Introduction
Water is the important natural resource that should be efficiently used. Our project ‘Automatic Pump and Water Level Controller’ uses the Arduino and Ultrasonic senser. The Basic idea of the project is to ensure the proper use of water and reduce the wastage of water. This basic idea can be implemented in many fields and purposes such as irrigation in agriculture land, water pump controlling water usage monitoring etc

## Working of the System

Water is the important natural resource that should be efficiently used. Our project ‘Automatic Pump and Water Level Controller’ uses the Arduino and Ultrasonic senser. The Basic idea of the project is to ensure the proper use of water and reduce the wastage of water. This basic idea can be implemented in many fields and purposes such as irrigation in agriculture land, water pump controlling water usage monitoring etc
### Advantages
- Easy installation.
-  Low maintenance.
- Compact and elegant design.
- Users can control the required level of water in over head tank. - Avoids wastage of water from tanks.
- It can maintain exact preset water levels.
- The  system  is  very  versatile,  a  numbers  of  tailor  made  variations  like  control  of multiple tanks or multiple pumps are possible.
- Being automatic saves man power.

### Applications
- Used in buildings where the manual monitoring is difficult.
- Used in industries to control the water level and in chemical mixing etc.
- It can be installed in metro cities where the drinking water is the only water used for all purposes which keeps the drinking water from being wasted. 
- Fuel tank level gauging.
- Oil tank level control.
- Pool water level control.

### Componenets used
- Arduino.
- Ultrasonic Sensor.
- LCD.
- BJT.
- Switch.
- LED.
- DC motor.


### Explanation
1. Arduino: 
    - Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
    - Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
    - You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.
    - To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

2. Ultrasonic Sensor:
    - An ultrasonic Sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound wave, and converts the reflected sound into an electical signal.
    - It is economical sensor provides 2.5cm to 400cm of non-contact measurement funtionality with a ranging accuracy that can reach upto 3mm, and it includes an ultrasonic trasmitter, a receiver and a control circuit.

3. LCD:
    - LCD csreen is a flat-panel display, electronic visual display that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystal and LCD's are available to display arbitrary images, Preset words, digits and 7-segment dispalys.

4. BJT:
    - BJT is a Bipolar Junction Transistor is a three-terminal semiconductor device that consists of two p-n junctions which are able to amplify or magnify a signal.
    - it is a current controlled device.
    - The three-terminals of BJT are base, the collector and the emitter.
    - It does require an external source of DC power supply to carry out the amplification process.

5. Switch: 
    - It is a small
    control for an electrial device used to make or break a connection in a circuit.

6. LED: 
    - LED is a light-emitting diode.
    - It is a semi-conductor diode that emits light when conducting current.

7. DC motor:
    - A DC motor is a class of electrical motors that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy.
