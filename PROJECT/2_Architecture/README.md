### 3.4 Explanation of components
1. `Arduino:` 

![Arduino](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98537406/155877578-41ca9a18-7c54-4932-9705-28ec1ab634e3.png)

   - Arduino UNO has the micro-controller ATmega328 embedded in it.
   - It has 14 digital I/O pins out of which 6 provide PWR output.
   - It is an open-source and provides prototype platform.
   - It also has a 16MHX crystal oscillator attach to it.
   - Inaddition to above features, it also has an USB connection,  a power jack, an ICSP, header and reset button.
   - It can simply be connect to a computer using an USB cable or power it with an AC or a DC adapter or a bettery.

2. `Ultrasonic Sensor:`

![UltrasonicSensor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98537406/155877878-0c855093-d640-40ef-8022-4f2e6245cd0e.png)

    - It is basically a distance sensor and is used for detecting the distance.
    - It has two ultrasonic transmitters namely the receiver and the control circuit.
    - The transmitter emits a high frequency ultrasonic sound wave which bounces off from any solid object and receiver receives it as an echo.
    - The echo is then processed by the difference between the transmitter and receiver signal.
    - This time can subsequently be used to measure the distance between the sensor and the reflecting object.
    - It has an ultrasonic frequency of 40 KHz and acurracy is near to 0.3 cm.
    

3. `LCD:`
    
    ![LCD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98537406/155878092-81772001-d662-4d11-9b78-c0d8645b9e89.png)

    
    - LCD csreen is a flat-panel display, electronic visual display that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystal and LCD's are available to display arbitrary images, Preset words, digits and 7-segment dispalys.


4. `LED:`
    
    ![LED](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98537406/155878183-74f5e449-fc88-4ff9-b24b-449a4b04d48f.png)

    
    - LED is a light-emitting diode.
    - It is a semi-conductor diode that emits light when conducting current.

5. `Relay:`
   
   ![Relay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98537406/155878245-7bd76c56-5154-4df1-b3e3-4d0529aed879.png)
   
   - In order to isolate two circuit electrically and to connect them magnetically relays are used.
   - They are very useful in switching from one circuit to another when they are completely seperated.
   - The relays comprise of an input and an output section.
   - The input section has a coil which produces magnetic field when a small voltage from an electrical circuit is applied.
   - This applied voltage is known as the operating voltage.

6. `DC motor:`

![DC motor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98537406/155878364-4bb38804-a7dc-48d6-892c-9b04c99f39bf.png)

    - A DC motor is a class of electrical motors that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy.
    - DC motors use magnetic fields that occur from the electrical currents generated, which powers the movement of a rotar fixed within the output shaft.
    - The output torque and speed depends upon both the electrical input and the design of the motor.
