### 3.4 Explanation of components
1. `Arduino:` 
    - Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
    - Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
    - You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.
    - To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

2. `Ultrasonic Sensor:`
    - An ultrasonic Sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound wave, and converts the reflected sound into an electical signal.
    - It is economical sensor provides 2.5cm to 400cm of non-contact measurement funtionality with a ranging accuracy that can reach upto 3mm, and it includes an ultrasonic trasmitter, a receiver and a control circuit.

3. `LCD:`
    - LCD csreen is a flat-panel display, electronic visual display that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystal and LCD's are available to display arbitrary images, Preset words, digits and 7-segment dispalys.

4. `BJT:`
    - BJT is a Bipolar Junction Transistor is a three-terminal semiconductor device that consists of two p-n junctions which are able to amplify or magnify a signal.
    - it is a current controlled device.
    - The three-terminals of BJT are base, the collector and the emitter.
    - It does require an external source of DC power supply to carry out the amplification process.

5. `Switch:` 
    - It is a small
    control for an electrial device used to make or break a connection in a circuit.

6. `LED:`
    - LED is a light-emitting diode.
    - It is a semi-conductor diode that emits light when conducting current.

7. `DC motor:`
    - A DC motor is a class of electrical motors that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy.
